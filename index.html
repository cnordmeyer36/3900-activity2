<p>
My name is Caleb Nordmeyer, I am currently in my Junior year at UNO studying for a Bachelor's in Management Information Systems.
 I went to high school in Bennington, and I currently work for Union Pacific as an intern at the Technology Build Center, where we
 supply the company's employees with hardware replacements such as laptops and work phones. We also diagnose devices and send them
 out for repair if necessary, in order to be as cost efficient as possible.

Outside of school and work I have a couple hobbies that I spend most of my time doing. On <a href="hobbies.html">this page</a> I will cover these in more detail.
