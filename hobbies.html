<h1>My hobbies</h1>
<p>
    I have a large amount of (expensive) interests that keep me entertained in my free time. 
    Some of these include golfing, target shooting, and RC car racing. But the hobby that I spend
    the most time (and money) on is painting miniatures for Warhammer, a tabletop war game. I am
    currently finishing up an army shown below, for a legion known as the Death Guard in game.

    My other, less expensive hobby is watching motorsports, and particularly Formula 1. My favorite
    team is Redbull and my favorite driver is Max Verstappen. Last year for my 21st birthday, my Dad
    and myself traveled to Texas to watch the United States Grand Prix.
